# Etch-a-Sketch

This project took me a bit I utilized Javascript, css and html to create a functional etch-a-sketch that is able to change color, erase lines, reset board, rescale the board, and utilize event listeners to turn on and off drawing mode.
I also used fun animal images to be the background for the buttons although it makes the button text a lil hard to read.
